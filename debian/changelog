vdr (1.4.5-2) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * NOT RELEASED YET
  * Set NONPTL=0 by default - since version 1.3.27 VDR should work with the
    Native Posix Threading Library without problems. NONPTL can now be
    enabled for AMD64 systems again, even if this should not be necessary.
  * Added KEYB_TTY_SWITCH option which, when set to "1", makes VDR switch to
    the console specified in KEYB_TTY on startup. Before this version, this
    was the default behaviour when KEYB_TTY was specified. Now it's optional
    and disabled by default.

    - Added 13_remote.dpatch from Darren Salt, this allows to have
      just 1 binary for all 4 possible control methods, and it should
      reduce build-time by about 75%
    - Removed packages vdr-daemon, vdr-kbd, vdr-lirc, vdr-rcu because 
      they are not necessary anymore
    - Added "Conflicts and Replaces: vdr-daemon, vdr-kbd, vdr-lirc,

vdr (1.2.6-6) unstable; urgency=high

  * Urgency high because it includes a fix for CAN-2005-0071
  * Thomas Günther <tom@toms-cafe.de>
    - new (optional) plugin check (with "vdr -V -P plugin")
    - Extracted patchlevel code to patchlevel.sh 
    - Installing patchlevel.sh into vdr-dev package
  * Tobias Grimm <tg@e-tobi.net>

    - moved PLUGIN_DIR, PLUGIN_PREFIX, CFG_DIR, PLUGIN_CFG_DIR,
      PLUGIN_ORDER_FILE, CMDHOOKSDIR, REC_CMD from the default file to 
      the init script
    - fixed bug in shutdown script (OSD messages have to be deferred until
      the shutdown script is finished)
    - removed PLUGIN_ORDER_FILE paramter, order.conf should always be in
      PLUGIN_CFG_DIR
    - set default location for epg.data to /var/cache/vdr (vdr -E)
    - The default command to shutdown the system when the power-off-key of the
      remote is pressed, can now be configured in /etc/default/vdr.
    - When processing the shutdown hooks, no further hook scripts will be
      processed, if one script requests to delay the shutdown.
    - Extracted loading of VDR daemon config options to separate file for
      later reuse by other start scripts
    - Fixed warning message in generated commands.conf and reccmds.conf  
  * Thomas Schmidt <thomas.schmidt@in.stud.tu-ilmenau.de>
    - Do not run as user root anymore, the user vdr will be created
      and the video-directory and config-files will be changed, so the
      owner/group is vdr:vdr (closes: #287899)
    - Added 07_not_as_root.dpatch - vdr exists when it should run as
      user or with group-id root (adapted from Darren Salt's patch 
      for vdr 1.3.x)
    - Added 08_security_CAN-2005-0071.dpatch - do not overwrite 
      existing files with the GRAB-Command anymore (CAN-2005-0071)
    - Set default port for SVDRP to 0, users who run vdr from the 
      commandline will have to enable it by using the --port option
      (in the init-script SVDRP will still be enabled and on the default 
      port 2001)
    - Added vdr-shutdown.wrapper with owner/group root:vdr and mode 6750, 
      which calls the normal vdr-shutdown-script so that the user vdr is 
      able to run vdr's shutdown-hooks
    - The automatic shutdown is now disabled by default, to enable it 
      again you have to change ENABLE_SHUTDOWN=0 to 1 in /etc/default/vdr
    - Changed package vdr to Architecture: any, because it now contains
      a binary file
    - Added patch from Ludwig Nussel to be able to syncronize the system-
      time via DVB, even when vdr runs as user
    - Build-depend on libcap-dev
    - Package vdr: depend on adduser
    - Remove some files under /var/lib/vdr and /var/cache/vdr in postrm 
      on purge (closes: #287914)
    - Added german (de.po) debconf-translation from Jens Nachtigall 
      <nachtigall@web.de> (closes: #273643)
    - Added a note to the package description and README.Debian that vdr
      (without special plugins) requires a DVB-Card with an mpeg-decoder
      (Closes: #287428)
    - Improved runvdr-script: when no loaded dvb-modules were found, 
      try to load the module dvb (could be an alias for the real 
      dvb-module)
    - Added XB-VDR-Patchlevel-field in debian/control to vdr-plugin-sky 
      and vdr-plugin-examples
    - Build-depend on dpatch (>= 2.0.9)
    - Converted existing dpatch-files to the new short format
    - Added newplugin-script as vdr-newplugin to vdr-dev, so 
      plugin-developers can initialize a new plugin-directory without a 
      normal vdr-source-tree
    - Added debianize-vdrplugin-script and the plugin-template-dir from 
      c't-vdr
    - Added lintian-override to avoid the lintian-warnings for the
      plugin-template-scripts
    - Default VIDEO_DIR is now /var/lib/video.00, so new harddiscs can
      be added very easy by mounting them to /var/lib/video.0{1,2,...}
      (if the old directory /var/lib/video exists, create 
      /var/lib/video.00 as symlink to the old directory, if it does
      not exist, /var/lib/video will be a symlink to /var/lib/video.00)
    - Removed unnecessary debconf-question about creating the dvb 
      devices, they will now be created without any question when they
      are not existing allready
    - Removed libncurses5-dev from Build-Depends
