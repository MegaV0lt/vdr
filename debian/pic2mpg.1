.SH NAME
pic2mpg \- convert pictures to MPEG for the VDR pictures plugin
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBpic2mpg\fR [\fIoptions\fR] \fIpicture-dir mpeg-dir\fR

\fBpic2mpg\fR [\fIoptions\fR] \fIpicture-file mpeg-file\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBpic2mpg\fR converts pictures found in a source dir to MPEG frames and writes
the MPEG files to the target dir. Instead of specifiying directories, single
files can be specified as well.

\fBpic2mpg\fR and the 'pictures' plugin require a particular directory structure
in order to work properly. Starting at some base directory
(e.g. "/path/to/pictures"), there is one directory level marking the year in
which the pictures were taken, followed by a level with a properly sortable
combination of month and description, and finally the plain picture files, as in

    /path/to/pictures/YEAR/MONTH_DESCRIPTION/*.jpg

For example

    /path/to/pictures/2007/06a_Vacation_in_Colorado/dsc01234.jpg
    /path/to/pictures/2007/06a_Vacation_in_Colorado/dsc01235.jpg
    /path/to/pictures/2007/06b_Our_cat/dsc01236.jpg

The MONTH is "01" for January through "12" for December. If there is more
than one entry for one month, it should be followed by a letter to make them
sort correctly. Note that this is just a suggestion on how to make the
directories sort in the correct chronological order. Instead of the two digit
month number, optionally followed by a letter, you can use anything else you
like. There must be an underscore between the MONTH and the DESCRIPTION part,
and any underscores within the DESCRIPTION will be converted to blanks when
displaying the description (this is done so that blanks can be avoided in
the directory names).
